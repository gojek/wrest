module Wrest #:nodoc:
  # Wrest::Uri provides a simple api for
  # REST calls. String#to_uri is a convenience
  # method to build a Wrest::Uri from a string url.
  # Note that a Wrest::Uri is immutable.
  #
  # Basic HTTP Authentication is supported.
  # Example:
  #  "http://kaiwren:fupuppies@coathangers.com/portal/1".to_uri
  #  "http://coathangers.com/portal/1".to_uri(:username => 'kaiwren', :password => 'fupuppies')
  # 
  # The second form is preferred as it can handle passwords with special characters like ^ and @
  #
  # You can find examples that use real APIs (like delicious) under the wrest/examples directory.
  class Uri
    attr_reader :uri, :username, :password, :uri_string, :uri_path, :query, :default_headers
    
    # Valid tuples for the options are:
    #   :asynchronous_backend => Can currently be set to either Wrest::AsyncRequest::EventMachineBackend.new
    #                            or Wrest::AsyncRequest::ThreadBackend.new. Easier to do using Uri#using_em and
    #                            Uri#using_threads.
    #   :callback             => Accepts a hash where the keys are response codes or ranges of response codes and
    #                            the values are the corresponding blocks that will be invoked should the response
    #                            code match the key.
    #   :default_headers      => Accepts a hash containing a set of default request headers with which the headers
    #                            passed to Uri#get, Uri#post etc. are merged. Incoming headers will override the
    #                            defaults if there are any clashes. Use this to set cookies or use OAuth2 Authorize
    #                            headers. When extending or cloning a Uri, passing in a new set of default_headers
    #                            will result in the old set being overridden.
    #   :username, :password  => HTTP authentication. Passing nil for either username or password will skip it.
    # See Wrest::Native::Request for other available options and their default values.

    #  uri['/oogas/1'].get
