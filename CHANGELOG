 * Multipart post and put using Net::Http

== 0.1.0
 * Added Nokogiri as a fallback for LibXML Ruby before we give up and use REXML. (Nokogiri is available on JRuby, unlike LibXML-ruby)
 * Added code to attempt to load JREXML (for what it's worth) when using REXML on JRuby

 * Support for keep-alive connections via Wrest::Http::Session and Wrest::Http::Response#connection_closed?
 * Create two convenience Post methods on Uri - one for application/x-www-form-urlencoded and the other normal
 * Optional libcurl implementations of the Request/Response classes (for those on MRI who need better performance). See examples/delicious.rb, examples/facebook.rb. Note that while there is a great deal of API compatibility, everything may not behave exactly the same under libcurl. Please do report inconsistencies.

== 0.0.8
 * Added URI extension using the [] method (see examples/delicious.rb)
 * Refactored out Request as the first step to adding Response caching
