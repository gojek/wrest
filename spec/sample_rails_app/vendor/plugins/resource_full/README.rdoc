= ResourceFull 0.7.5

* http://github.com/bguthrie/resource_full/

== DESCRIPTION

ResourceFull integrated with ActionController to provide a comprehensive 
RESTful resource modeling and querying framework.  It provides parameter 
queryability, paging, sorting, separation of controller concerns, multiple 
formats (HTML, XML, JSON), CRUD access permissions, and API metadata 
surrounding the resource itself. It's opinionated but is intended to provide 
you with as much as possible without limiting your ability to customize its
behavior.

== GOALS

The major distinguishing features of ResourceFull are:

* Queryability: the ability to designate certain parameters as queryable,
  and map them to columns and SQL queries in the underlying model.
  These queries chain together multiple named or unnamed scopes and can be
  used either for a SQL SELECT or SELECT COUNT.
  This functionality may be moved into a separate plugin in the future.
* Pagination and orderability: it automatically responds to requests for
  limit, offset, order_by, and order_dir.
* Implementation: Default implementations for HTML, XML, and JSON controller requests.
* API documentation: ResourceFull-enabled Rails apps are able to provide automatic
  documentation of the resources they expose, up to a point.  (This is enabled
  in large part by the queryability functionality and other resource-level
  descriptors.)  It's my hope that this can eventually be consumed by a Rails
  resource registrar that acts as the single source of record for multiple REST
  engines within an organization.

== EXAMPLE

  class UsersController < ResourceFull::Base
    identified_by :username, :unless => lambda { |id| id =~ /^[0-9]+$/ }
    
    queryable_with :city, :state, :from => :address
    queryable_with :name, :columns => [:first_name, :last_name]
    queryable_with :email_address, :fuzzy => true
    queryable_with :is_active, :scope => :active

    orderable_by :city, :from => :address
    
    responds_to :html
    responds_to :xml, :only => [:read, :update]
  end
  
  class AddressesController < ResourceFull::Base
    nests_within :users
    queryable_with :city, :state
  end

This allows for the following:

  /users/bguthrie.xml
  /users?name=Guthrie
  /users?email_address=gmail
  /users.xml?city=Chicago&name=Brian,Paul,Alicia&order_by=city&order_dir=asc
  /users.xml?limit=10&offset=30
  /users/bguthrie/addresses

  >> UsersController.to_xml
  => "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<resource>\n  <parameters type=\"array\"/>..."

== API DOCUMENTATION

To enable ResourceFull to document your resources at /resources.xml and /resources/<name>/routes.xml, 
add +map.api+ to your +routes.rb+ file.
